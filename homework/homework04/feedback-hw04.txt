Total possible points        90 points

========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 86.0/ 90.0 which is 95.56% which would be an A
   minus 10% for lateness makes 85.56 which is a B

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 6: I think you have a and b mixed up in the first couple of lines,
   but the rest of the algorithm is correct.

problem 7: this isn't actually going to swap anything.  You are reading a
   value and storing it to var, then loading a value from memory and storing
   THAT value to var, which overwrites the value you read from the port.

Well done!

SEMESTER SCORE SO FAR:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~  92.50% of  5 points =  4.63 points
   homework03 ~  77.63% of  5 points =  3.88 points
   homework04 ~  85.56% of  5 points =  4.28 points
                                total: 17.79 out of 20.0 = 88.94%
                                which is a B-plus
