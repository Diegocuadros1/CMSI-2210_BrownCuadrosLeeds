1)A three-input system has two of its inputs going to a two-input AND 
gate and the third going to an INVERTER. The outputs of the AND gate and the inverter are inputs to a single OR gate, whose output goes to an INVERTER which provides the output for the system.
2)A three-input system has two of its inputs going to a two-input 
NAND gate. The third input and the output of the NAND gate are inputs to an AND gate which provides the output for the system.
3)A three-input system has A, B, and X inputs. A and X are both \
inputs to an AND gate. The X input also goes to an INVERTER whose output goes with B to another AND gate. The outputs of both the AND gates go to an OR gate which provides the output for the system.
4)A NOR gate is an OR gate with an INVERTER on the output. Use a truth table to determine if this is the same thing as an AND gate in terms of its outputs.
5)A four-input system has A, B, C, and D inputs. A goes to an INVERTER
and then goes to an XOR gate with B. The output of the XOR gate goes to an AND gate which is paired with the C input. The C input also goes to an INVERTER which then goes to an OR gate with the D input. The output of the OR gate and the output of the AND gate go to a NAND gate which provides the output for the system.
